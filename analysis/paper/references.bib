Until I asked hirn, that iso In a response to a paper he gave to the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association (URISA) in the summer of 1987, he told me that someone in the audience who he cannot quite remember, actually coined the term, referring to 'planning support systems' as that constellation of digital techniques (such as GIS) which were emerging to support the planning process. In fact, the predecessor term 'decision support systems' (DSS) from which this unknown originator obviously defined PSS by analogy, was coined as far back as the late 1970s in the management literature for a loose assemblage of techniques, usually computer-based, which aided management decisions. The term slowly entered the geographicallexicon as 'spatial decision support systems' (SDSS) and this is probably first attributable to Lew Hopkins and Mark Armstrong who used it in a paper published in AutoCarto 7 in 1985 (Hopkins and Armstrong 1985).},

However, an increasing number of voices has been calling for more reflexivity, criticizing the nation-state- and ethnicity-centred epistemology that often informs this discipline. Consistently with this line of reasoning, I argue that migration and integration research originates in a historically institutionalized nation-state migration apparatus and is thus entangled with a particular normalization discourse. Therefore, this field of study contributes to reproducing the categories of this particular migration apparatus. This entanglement poses some serious dilemmas for this research tradition, dilemmas that ask for further consideration and possible solutions. My main proposition is to ‘de-migranticize' migration and integration research. I outline possible ways of doing so and discuss the consequences of such a strategy for the future of migration and integration studies.},

	abstract = {After rapid urban growth and industrialisation, the postwar era has seen counterurbanisation become a dominant demographic trend in the UK. Much has been written about the residential patterns of counterurbanisation, but the associated growth of rural business has attracted less attention. The author proposes the term ‘commercial counterurbanisation’ to describe the growth of rural economies stimulated by inward migration. In the North East of England, in-migrants own over half of rural microbusinesses, they are more growth-oriented, and they are responsible for considerably more employment than the whole of the agriculture sector. In arguing that commercial counterurbanisation is more than just a spatial decentralisation of business activity, the author explores the social as well as the economic motivations of ‘counterurbanising’ business owners. Commercial counterurbanisation can be a two-stage process, as the decision to work in a rural area or run a rural business may occur several years after a residential move. Where this time lag exists, in-migrant business owners will be influenced by different factors in different locations. In the context of neoendogenous development, the balance of local and extralocal forces is particularly significant. This leads to the conclusion that in-migrant business owners need to become embedded into the rural community for the wider rural economy to realise the maximum benefits from commercial counterurbanisation.},

In the late nineteenth-century United States, standard measures suggest a counterintuitive pattern: southern cities, with their long history of racial inequality, had less residential segregation than urban areas considered to be more racially tolerant. By using census enumeration procedures, we develop a sequence measure that captures a more subtle “backyard” pattern of segregation, where white families dominated front streets and blacks were relegated to alleys. Our analysis of complete household data from the 1880 Census documents how segregation took various forms across the postbellum United States. Whereas northern cities developed segregation via racialized neighborhoods, substituting residential inequality for the status inequality of slavery, southern cities embraced street-front segregation that reproduced the racial inequality that existed under slavery.},

This paper describes the effects of immigration on overall population growth and the skill composition of cities, focusing on the connection between immigrant inflows and the relative number of less-skilled workers in the local population. The labor market impacts of immigrant arrivals can be offset by outflows of natives and earlier generations of immigrants. Empirically, however, these offsetting flows are small, so most cities with higher rates of immigration have experienced overall population growth and a rising share of the less-skilled. These supply shifts are associated with a modest widening of the wage gap between more- and less-skilled natives, coupled with a positive effect on average native wages. Beyond the labor market, immigrant arrivals also affect rents and housing prices, government revenues and expenses, and the composition of neighborhoods and schools. The effect on rents is the same magnitude as the effect on average wages, implying that the average "rent burden" (the ratio of rents to incomes) is roughly constant. The local fiscal effects of increased immigration also appear to be relatively small. The neighborhood and school externalities posed by the presence of lowincome and minority families may be larger, and may be a key factor in understanding native reactions to immigration.},

We use regression discontinuity methods and Census tract data from 1970 through 2000 to test for discontinuities in the dynamics of neighborhood racial composition. We find strong evidence that white population flows exhibit tipping-like behavior in most cities, with a distribution of tipping points ranging from 5\% to 20\% minority share. Tipping is prevalent both in the suburbs and near existing minority enclaves. In contrast to white population flows, there is little evidence of nonlinearities in rents or housing prices around the tipping point. Tipping points are higher in cities where whites have more tolerant racial attitudes.},

	abstract = {Households "sort" across neighborhoods according to their wealth and their preferences for public goods, social characteristics, and commuting opportunities. The aggregation of these individual choices in markets and in other institutions influences the supply of amenities and local public goods. Pollution, congestion, and the quality of public education are examples. Over the past decade, advances in economic models of this sorting process have led to new framework that promises to alter the ways we conceptualize the policy evaluation process in the future. These "equilibrium sorting" models use the properties of market equilibria, together with information on household behavior, to infer structural parameters that characterize preference heterogeneity. The results can be used to develop theoretically consistent predictions for the welfare implications of future policy changes. Analysis is not confined to marginal effects or a partial equilibrium setting. Nor is it limited to prices and quantities. Sorting models can integrate descriptions of how non-market goods are generated, estimate how they affect decision making and, in turn, predict how they will be affected by future policies targeting prices or quantities. Conversely, sorting models can predict how equilibrium prices and quantities will be affected by policies which target product quality, information, or amenities generated by the sorting process. These capabilities are just beginning to be understood and used in applied research. This survey article aims to synthesize the state of knowledge on equilibrium sorting, the new possibilities for policy analysis, and the conceptual and empirical challenges that define the frontiers of the literature.},

Reasons for differences between sources are explored with reference to outlier local authorities, where the differences are greatest. Comparison is also made with ONS estimates of immigration used in the mid- 2006 estimates. Overall a good level of consistency is found between some sources. This indicates that there is scope for using such sources in modelling or linking approaches to improve ONS estimates. However a number of outliers are identified where estimates are more divergent. These need to be explored further before improvements can be made. Among the most important reasons for differences between estimates are the populations covered by the sources, different length of stay criterion and non-compulsory registration with some sources.},

One possibility is that immigrants to a specific area simply push non-immigrants onwards elsewhere, thereby diffusing the labour market effects. Examining net internal migration between 11 regions of Britain over two decades, we find consistently negative displacement effects but their magnitude and significance varies. The effects are somewhat stronger for the southern regions where immigration from abroad is concentrated. The results suggest that internal migration is one of the mechanisms through which regional labour markets adjust to immigration shocks.},

	title = {Estimating the {Missing} {People} in the {UK} 1991 {Population} {Census}},
	isbn = {978-1-5049-9423-1},
	abstract = {In order to assess the coverage and the quality of the census data of the 1991 census, the Census Validation Survey (CVS) was carried out by the Social Survey Division of OPCS. The survey produced estimates of household spaces, households, and persons together with 95 percent confidence intervals. The CVS estimated the census undercount from six different samples, five of which were drawn from the census records and hence dependent. From the comparison between 1991 census results and demographic estimates, it was felt that CVS failed to estimate the true undercount figure of the 1991 census. Moreover, the CVS methodology was unable to estimate the undercount by age, sex, race, and geographic categories. This book presents methods for estimating population by age, sex, and race, as well as geographic categories. Three different estimators, Chandra-Sekar, Greenfield, and El-Sayed Nour, using information from two different sources (census and survey), are discussed. Adjustment factors are generally computed as the ratios of these estimates to the census counts. Average estimates from these three estimators may produce better adjustment factors. Models to produce more accurate estimates of the size of the closed population by using a second sample by matching with census and survey are also discussed. The models we present provide a mechanism for separating out the dependence between census and survey data induced by individual heterogeneity. The resulting data take the form of 2x2x2 table, in which only one of the eight cells is unknown. Using log-linear quasi-symmetry models we describe how to estimate the expected values of the observable cells of this table. To estimate the populations for local authorities (LA), a regression method is presented. The resulting estimates are found to be more accurate than the CVS estimates and were also close to the 1991 demographic estimates. We describe a methodology for estimating the accuracy of the dual systems estimates of population with the help of hypothetical data. The methodology is based on decompositions of the total error into components, such as sampling error, matching error, and other nonsampling errors. An imputation method and some recommendations are also discussed.},

Most migration studies are concerned with the determinants of international migration to the UK. Few look at the drivers of the spatial distributions once migrants arrive. However, migrant housing is primarily a local, urban problem and, arguably, the main issue is the spatial concentrations, rather than absolute numbers. The UK has experienced waves of migrants throughout its history and these are well documented in the censuses since the mid 19th century. A feature of the study is its long-run perspective, which allows the examination of the characteristics of the different waves and shows the high degree of persistence in spatial structures. The second part of the study examines why there is little evidence that migration has much effect on house prices, despite the popular perception that the impact is important. The study demonstrates that the nature of housing market adjustment is more complex than price indicators alone would suggest. Adjustment also takes place through changes to household formation and through the mobility of domestic residents, which mitigate the price effects.},

On the one hand, strong labour market conditions, as exemplified by low unemployment rates and high earnings, draw migrants into regions. On the other hand, strong housing market conditions can prevent movement since commuting may often be an alternative to migration. This can be thought of as giving rise to a migration equilibrium where high house prices choke off migration caused by strong labour market conditions. Expected capital gains in housing, however, can offset high levels of house prices, an effect ignored in previous literature. Migration can also be influenced more directly by the availability of housing relative to population without this being mediated through prices.

We examine the information that can be derived from changing two of those parameters the distance band used to define spatial proximity and the statistical significance of the local statistic using data on two ethnic groups (Asians and Pacific Islanders) in Auckland.

Progress has been made in understanding drivers of migration, and we have relatively good data on immigrant populations, but we lack information on how many people leave their country each year to settle elsewhere and who these emigrants are. The impact of migration on the individual and on sending and receiving communities and countries is only partly understood. Economic effects can be very different from the impacts on society and culture; some gain from migration, whereas others lose. The lack of knowledge creates systemic risks and uncertainties and frustrates public debate and the formation of effective policies.

Through detailed small-area census analysis of Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff and Swansea, supplemented by household surveys and key informant interviews, the research points to a range of population characteristics and changes occurring in the British city centre. Certain characteristics such as a high proportion of lone person households, fewer children and low car ownership remain fairly consistent. However, substantial population expansion affirms that a large part of the population is “new”. Between 1991 and 2001, men came to outnumber women, and each of the city centres saw a relative expansion of its young adult population. The new residents have a higher appreciation than longer term residents of proximity to work and leisure facilities, and of the stylishness of city centre living. Most of the new residents rent their accommodation, generally in flats, and the predominance of renting is associated with a transient attitude to city centre residence among the new population. Socio-economic evidence indicates a striking rise in social status or gentrification in all the city centres investigated, especially where high status private housing developments encourage the trend. With policies promoting residential development, the city centre is becoming increasingly socially exclusive.},

In this article we show that the doubts are invalid-that decreasing ratios of net to gross migration, as education increases, are due to increasing efficiency of past (and present) migration which, in turn, generate higher regional earnings equality, as education increases. Higher regional equality tends to generate more movement in the "wrong" direction-against the median income gradient.},

Within the European Union, legislation guaranteeing the free movement of people between countries means that national governments are unable to control immigration in the ways that they would sometimes prefer. Migrants within the EU are primarily influenced by economic factors and so the potential for influencing migration through pre-existing systems for wealth redistribution are explored. It is shown that relatively small changes in regional economic and labour market inequalities can have large effects on migration volumes, but that for flows which are currently causing worry for governments, such as those from Romania and Bulgaria to the UK, the evidence is that present levels of wealth redistribution are unlikely to alter conditions sufficiently to arrest potential movements.},

This paper explores the effect of net migration in two different countries, Australia and the United Kingdom, using measures of migration effectiveness computed from period-age migration data sets for a system of city regions assembled for four consecutive five-year periods in each country. While the evidence suggests that the overall effectiveness of net migration has declined over the 20-year period in both countries, marked similarities and contrasts are apparent in the spatial patterning of migration that together provide useful analytical insights into the changing space economies of the two countries.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the results of an extensive project to model interregional migration within England and Wales. The project took place over a two-year period and was sponsored by the UK Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (formerly the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions). The results of the study are reported in three separate papers. In this paper we present an overview of the project and then describe in detail both the process of modelling out-migration rates from origins across England and Wales and the calibration results from this modelling stage. The results yield important information on the determinants of out-migration and population re-distribution within England and Wales. In paper 2 we describe the modelling of the destination choices of migrants and the calibration results from such models. In paper 3 we tie both the out-migration and the destination choice results together into a mapping and visualisation system (MIGMOD) which can be used to assess the impacts of various policies on population movements in England and Wales. The simple policy scenarios reported in this third paper are illustrative and indicative of the model's potential, rather than necessarily being a true reflection of the effects of policy changes. The three papers contribute substantially to the existing migration literature because they present the most exhaustive analysis of the determinants of both out-migration and destination choice that has ever been undertaken. The number of variables in both modelling processes is far larger than has ever been assembled before and the results therefore provide much greater insight into the role of various attributes in determining out-migration rates and in-migration rates than has previously been possible. The papers also provide an interesting lesson in a problem rarely encountered—that of having too much data.},

Some thirty years of government policies, social service practices and public perceptions have been framed by a particular understanding of immigration and multicultural diversity. That is, Britain's immigrant and ethnic minority population has conventionally been characterized by large, well-organized African-Caribbean and South Asian communities of citizens originally from Commonwealth countries or formerly colonial territories. Policy frameworks and public understanding – and, indeed, many areas of social science – have not caught up with recently emergent demographic and social patterns. Britain can now be characterized by ‘super-diversity,’ a notion intended to underline a level and kind of complexity surpassing anything the country has previously experienced. Such a condition is distinguished by a dynamic interplay of variables among an increased number of new, small and scattered, multiple-origin, transnationally connected, socio-economically differentiated and legally stratified immigrants who have arrived over the last decade. Outlined here, new patterns of super-diversity pose significant challenges for both policy and research.},

	abstract = {Households "sort" across neighborhoods according to their wealth and their preferences for public goods, social characteristics, and commuting opportunities. The aggregation of these individual choices in markets and in other institutions influences the supply of amenities and local public goods. Pollution, congestion, and the quality of public education are examples. Over the past decade, advances in economic models of this sorting process have led to new framework that promises to alter the ways we conceptualize the policy evaluation process in the future. These "equilibrium sorting" models use the properties of market equilibria, together with information on household behavior, to infer structural parameters that characterize preference heterogeneity. The results can be used to develop theoretically consistent predictions for the welfare implications of future policy changes. Analysis is not confined to marginal effects or a partial equilibrium setting. Nor is it limited to prices and quantities. Sorting models can integrate descriptions of how non-market goods are generated, estimate how they affect decision making and, in turn, predict how they will be affected by future policies targeting prices or quantities. Conversely, sorting models can predict how equilibrium prices and quantities will be affected by policies which target product quality, information, or amenities generated by the sorting process. These capabilities are just beginning to be understood and used in applied research. This survey article aims to synthesize the state of knowledge on equilibrium sorting, the new possibilities for policy analysis, and the conceptual and empirical challenges that define the frontiers of the literature.},

It is often observed that the numbers of migrants in the two periods are not linearly related; that is, the number of migrants over five years is less than five times the number over one year. A simple stochastic model embodying population-accounting principles is developed to show why this is the case, and that the relationship between one-year and five-year figures is a complex one involving some multiple migrations, some return migrations, and some deaths.},

The instability creates a net change in size of some ethnic groups that is usually small compared with the change in population between censuses from births, deaths and migration. Consequences for analysis of census aggregate and microdata are explored.},

We propose a way to nest and test survival models and utilise this in the model specification. We find that the intensity of the outflow of native Norwegian from an area is not to any substantial degree related to the size of the immigrant population. Hence, our results do not confirm the widespread narrative of white flight as a response to an increased immigrant population in areas of Oslo. Instead, the larger part of the outflow is explained by variables related to the life-course of families. Results do not suggest that increasing the ethnic or income diversity of Oslo neighbourhoods would substantially increase outflows of native Norwegians.},

The present paper rectifies that situation by, for the first time, modelling ethnic segregation in London at the 2001 and 2011 censuses within a Bayesian statistical framework at three scales, which allows for the statistical significance of any changes to be formally assessed – something not possible before. It finds that for many of the groups studied segregation was as great, if not greater, at the macro-scale as at the micro-scale, with both measures larger than at the meso-scale, with significant reductions in segregation across the decade, especially at the micro-scale.},

But there is relatively little good, recent, qualitative material available, which explores the process of decision‐making—including decisions regarding housing—within minority ethnic families. A missing element, therefore, is the study of action by householders and consequently, the realisation (or otherwise) of preferences and the cumulative results of actions in facilitating or restricting choice. The present paper reports on a small‐scale research study of Pakistani housing preferences in Glasgow, whose aim was to develop a life history interviewing technique, using a semi‐structured schedule, focusing on housing preferences, housing moves and experiences. Pakistani households are shown to experience continuing difficulties in funding and organising household moves. There are areas of Glasgow where families feel unsafe and there is a continuing problem of racial harassment. Neither the local authority nor housing associations are generally able to offer appropriate housing. The life history interviewing technique used allows an exploration of how households reached decisions on their housing and on how they indulged in ‘trade‐offs’ between different houses, areas or tenures. Thus our understanding of the role of agency in the development of patterns of housing and individual housing careers is developed.},

On the one hand, strong labour market conditions, as exemplified by low unemployment rates and high earnings, draw migrants into regions. On the other hand, strong housing market conditions can prevent movement since expensive housing can deter migrants and commuting may often be an alternative. This can be thought of as giving rise to a migration equilibrium, where high house prices choke off migration caused by strong labour market conditions. Expected capital gains in housing and expected earnings growth however, can offset high levels of house prices, effects ignored in previous literature. Migration can also be influenced more directly by the availability of housing relative to population without this being mediated through prices. This paper presents evidence from a 28 year panel on net and gross migration for the regions of Britain that is broadly in accord with these expectations.},

	abstract = {This case study examines recent population change patterns and internal migration activity in the United Kingdom. A wealth of knowledge about population dynamics in Britain is revealed. The spatial patterns of population change and net migration are intricate mosaics of gains and losses. Gains and losses in population were principally determined by net internal migration.  The decade long population change patterns and one year long migration patterns were in close
agreement. This was surprising in view of temporal instability in population change and migration patterns. The dominant spatial pattern was one of deconcentration from the cores of city regions to hinterlands for both the largest metropolises and also their subsidiary partner cities. There were also signs of loss in population and migrants in declining resource regions(former mining areas, fishing ports) and gains in new resource frontiers - particularly in northeast Scotland reflecting the vigorous development of onshore facilities for the offshore oil and gas fields of the North Sea. The pattern of overall population and migrant redistribution was predominantly that of the middle labour force/family ages reinforced at much lower mobility levels but with sharper patterns of redistribution by the pre-retirement and retirement ages.  People in the young adult ages in contrast redistributed to different destinations, showing a unique shift to the dense neighbourhoods of big cities. With respect to the urban system, there was significant redistribution both downward and outward. Downward redistribution meant shifts from large metropolitan cities to medium and small sized freestanding cities. Outward redistribution meant shifts to the outer commuting rings around cities, often deep into the countryside, This was not a return to the rural idyll, merely the expansion of the daily urban systems to cover most of lowland Britain. Strong preferences for low density living were revealed by shifts towards districts in Rural Areas and by net flows to low density wards and
sectors. Similar strong shifts out of areas of above average into below average unemployment were detected, though both relationships with density and unemployment were either not
present or weak for young adults. Some ambiguity was revealed in the fortunes of Inner London areas. Migration data from the 1991 Census showed intense outward movement.
Downward population shifts were on a lesser scale because of the compensating effects of higher than average natural increase and high immigration. However, a re-analysis of 1991 population by ONS led to a substantial upward revision of London borough populations, and so places doubt on the size of outward shift of population through internal migration.},

While the results challenge the idea that there has been a global increase in volume, diversity, and geographical scope of migration, main migratory shifts have been directional. Migration has globalized from a destination country perspective but hardly from an origin country perspective, with migrants from an increasingly diverse array of non-European-origin countries concentrating in a shrinking pool of prime destination countries. The global migration map has thus become more skewed. Rather than refuting the globalization of migration hypothesis, this seems to reflect the asymmetric nature of globalization processes in general.},
